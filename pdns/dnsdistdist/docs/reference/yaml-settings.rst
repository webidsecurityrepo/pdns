YAML configuration reference
============================

Since 2.0.0, :program:`dnsdist` supports the YAML configuration format in addition to the existing Lua one.

If the configuration file passed to :program:`dnsdist` via the ``-C`` command-line switch ends in ``.yml``, it is assumed to be in the new YAML format, and an attempt to load a Lua configuration file with the same name but the ``.lua`` will be done before loading the YAML configuration. If the names ends in ``.lua``, there will also be an attempt to find a file with the same name but ending in ``.yml``. Otherwise the existing Lua configuration format is assumed.

A YAML configuration file contains several sections, that are described below.

.. _yaml-settings-BackendConfiguration:

BackendConfiguration
--------------------

Generic settings for backends

- **address**: String - ``ip``:``port`` of the backend server (if unset, port defaults to 53 for Do53 backends, 853 for DoT and DoQ, and 443 for DoH and DoH3 ones
- **id**: String ``("")`` - Use a pre-defined UUID instead of a random one
- **name**: String ``("")`` - The name associated to this backend, for display purpose
- **protocol**: String - The DNS protocol to use to contact this backend. Supported values are: Do53, DoT, DoH
- **tls**: :ref:`OutgoingTlsConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingTlsConfiguration>` - TLS-related settings for DoT and DoH backends
- **doh**: :ref:`OutgoingDohConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingDohConfiguration>` - DoH-related settings for DoH backends
- **use_client_subnet**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether to add (or override, see :ref:`yaml-settings-EdnsClientSubnetConfiguration`) an EDNS Client Subnet to the DNS payload before forwarding it to the backend. Please see :doc:`../advanced/passing-source-address` for more information
- **use_proxy_protocol**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Add a proxy protocol header to the query, passing along the client's IP address and port along with the original destination address and port
- **queries_per_second**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Limit the number of queries per second to ``number``, when using the ``firstAvailable`` policy
- **order**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - The order of this server, used by the `leastOutstanding` and `firstAvailable` policies
- **weight**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - The weight of this server, used by the `wrandom`, `whashed` and `chashed` policies, default: 1. Supported values are a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 2147483647
- **pools**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - List of pools to place this backend into. By default a server is placed in the default ("") pool
- **tcp**: :ref:`OutgoingTcpConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingTcpConfiguration>` - TCP-related settings for a backend
- **ip_bind_addr_no_port**: Boolean ``(true)`` - Whether to enable ``IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT`` if available
- **health_checks**: :ref:`HealthCheckConfiguration <yaml-settings-HealthCheckConfiguration>` - Health-check settings
- **source**: String ``("")`` - The source address or interface to use for queries to this backend, by default this is left to the kernel's address selection.
  The following formats are supported:

  - address, e.g. ``""192.0.2.2""``
  - interface name, e.g. ``""eth0""``
  - address@interface, e.g. ``""192.0.2.2@eth0""``

- **sockets**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - Number of UDP sockets (and thus source ports) used toward the backend server, defaults to a single one. Note that for backends which are multithreaded, this setting will have an effect on the number of cores that will be used to process traffic from dnsdist. For example you may want to set ``sockets`` to a number somewhat greater than the number of worker threads configured in the backend, particularly if the Linux kernel is being used to distribute traffic to multiple threads listening on the same socket (via ``reuseport``). See also ``randomize_outgoing_sockets_to_backend`` in :ref:`yaml-settings-UdpTuningConfiguration`
- **disable_zero_scope**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Disable the EDNS Client Subnet :doc:`../advanced/zero-scope` feature, which does a cache lookup for an answer valid for all subnets (ECS scope of 0) before adding ECS information to the query and doing the regular lookup. Default is false. This requires the ``parse_ecs`` option of the corresponding cache to be set to true
- **reconnect_on_up**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Close and reopen the sockets when a server transits from Down to Up. This helps when an interface is missing when dnsdist is started
- **max_in_flight**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - Maximum number of in-flight queries. The default is 0, which disables out-of-order processing. It should only be enabled if the backend does support out-of-order processing. Out-of-order processing needs to be enabled on the frontend as well
- **tcp_only**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Always forward queries to that backend over TCP, never over UDP. Always enabled for TLS backends
- **auto_upgrade**: :ref:`OutgoingAutoUpgradeConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingAutoUpgradeConfiguration>` - Auto-upgrade related settings
- **max_concurrent_tcp_connections**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Maximum number of TCP connections to that backend. When that limit is reached, queries routed to that backend that cannot be forwarded over an existing connection will be dropped. Default is 0 which means no limit
- **proxy_protocol_advertise_tls**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether to set the SSL Proxy Protocol TLV in the proxy protocol payload sent to the backend if the query was received over an encrypted channel (DNSCrypt, DoQ, DoH or DoT). Requires ``use_proxy_protocol``
- **mac_address**: String ``("")`` - When the ``xsk`` option is set, this parameter can be used to specify the destination MAC address to use to reach the backend. If this options is not specified, dnsdist will try to get it from the IP of the backend by looking into the system's MAC address table, but it will fail if the corresponding MAC address is not present
- **cpus**: String ``("")`` - Set the CPU affinity for this thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the ``pthread_setaffinity_np()`` function
- **xsk**: String ``("")`` - The name of an XSK sockets map to attach to this frontend, if any


.. _yaml-settings-BindConfiguration:

BindConfiguration
-----------------

General settings for frontends

- **listen_address**: String - Address and port to listen to
- **reuseport**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Set the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` socket option, allowing several sockets to be listening on this address and port

- **threads**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - Number of listening threads to create for this frontend
- **interface**: String ``("")`` - Set the network interface to use
- **cpus**: String ``("")`` - Set the CPU affinity for this listener thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the ``pthread_setaffinity_np()`` function
- **enable_proxy_protocol**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether to expect a proxy protocol v2 header in front of incoming queries coming from an address allowed by the ACL in :ref:`yaml-settings-ProxyProtocolConfiguration`. Default is ``true``, meaning that queries are expected to have a proxy protocol payload if they come from an address present in the proxy protocol ACL
- **tcp**: :ref:`IncomingTcpConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingTcpConfiguration>` - TCP-specific settings
- **tls**: :ref:`IncomingTlsConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingTlsConfiguration>` - TLS-specific settings
- **doh**: :ref:`IncomingDohConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingDohConfiguration>` - DNS over HTTPS-specific settings
- **doq**: :ref:`IncomingDoqConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingDoqConfiguration>` - DNS over QUIC-specific settings
- **quic**: :ref:`IncomingQuicConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingQuicConfiguration>` - QUIC-specific settings
- **dnscrypt**: :ref:`IncomingDnscryptConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingDnscryptConfiguration>` - DNSCrypt-specific settings
- **additional_addresses**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - List of additional addresses (with port) to listen on. Using this option instead of creating a new frontend for each address avoids the creation of new thread and Frontend objects, reducing the memory usage. The drawback is that there will be a single set of metrics for all addresses
- **xsk**: String ``("")`` - The name of an XSK sockets map to attach to this frontend, if any


.. _yaml-settings-CacheSettingsConfiguration:

If ``ffi`` is false, this function takes a table of :class:`Server` objects and a :class:`DNSQuestion` representing the current query, and must return the index of the selected server in the supplied table. If ``ffi`` is true, this function takes a ``const dnsdist_ffi_servers_list_t*`` and a ``dnsdist_ffi_dnsquestion_t*``
- **function_code**: String ``("")`` - Same than ``function_name`` but contain actual Lua code returning a function instead of a name
- **function_file**: String ``("")`` - Same than ``function_name`` but contain the path to a file containing actual Lua code returning a function instead of a name
- **ffi**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether the function uses the faster but more complicated Lua FFI API
- **per_thread**: Boolean ``(false)`` - If set, the resulting policy will be executed in a lock-free per-thread context, instead of running in the global Lua context. Note that ``function_name`` cannot be used, since this needs the Lua code to create the function in a new Lua context instead of just a function


.. _yaml-settings-DnstapLoggerConfiguration:

- **name**: String - Name of this endpoint
- **transport**: String - The dnstap transport to use. Supported values are: unix, tcp

.. _yaml-settings-DynamicRulesConfiguration:

DynamicRulesConfiguration
-------------------------

Group of dynamic rules

- **name**: String - The name of this group of dynamic rules
- **mask_ipv4**: Unsigned integer ``(32)`` - Number of bits to keep for IPv4 addresses
- **mask_ipv6**: Unsigned integer ``(64)`` - Number of bits to keep for IPv6 addresses. In some scenarios it might make sense to block a whole /64 IPv6 range instead of a single address, for example
- **mask_port**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Number of bits of port to consider over IPv4, for CGNAT deployments. Default is 0 meaning that the port is not taken into account. For example passing ``2`` here, which only makes sense if the IPv4 parameter is set to ``32``, will split a given IPv4 address into four port ranges: ``0-16383``, ``16384-32767``, ``32768-49151`` and ``49152-65535``
- **exclude_ranges**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - Exclude this list of ranges, meaning that no dynamic block will ever be inserted for clients in that range. Default to empty, meaning rules are applied to all ranges. When used in combination with ``include_ranges`` the more specific entry wins
- **include_ranges**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - Include this list of ranges, meaning that dynamic rules will be inserted for clients in that range. When used in combination with ``exclude_ranges`` the more specific entry wins
- **exclude_domains**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - Exclude this list of domains, meaning that no dynamic rules will ever be inserted for this domain via ``suffix-match`` or ``suffix-match-ffi`` rules. Default to empty, meaning rules are applied to all domains
- **rules**: Sequence of :ref:`DynamicRuleConfiguration <yaml-settings-DynamicRuleConfiguration>` - List of dynamic rules in this group


.. _yaml-settings-DynamicRulesSettingsConfiguration:

DynamicRulesSettingsConfiguration
---------------------------------

Dynamic rules-related settings

- **purge_interval**: Unsigned integer ``(60)`` - Set at which interval, in seconds, the expired dynamic blocks entries will be effectively removed from the tree. Entries are not applied anymore as soon as they expire, but they remain in the tree for a while for performance reasons. Removing them makes the addition of new entries faster and frees up the memory they use. Setting this value to 0 disables the purging mechanism, so entries will remain in the tree
- **default_action**: String ``(Drop)`` - Set which action is performed when a query is blocked. Supported values are: Drop, NoOp, NoRecurse, NXDomain, Refused, Truncate


.. _yaml-settings-EbpfConfiguration:

-----------------

``eBPF`` and ``XDP`` related settings

- **ipv4**: :ref:`EbpfMapConfiguration <yaml-settings-EbpfMapConfiguration>` - IPv4 map

- **cidr_ipv4**: :ref:`EbpfMapConfiguration <yaml-settings-EbpfMapConfiguration>` - IPv4 subnets map
- **cidr_ipv6**: :ref:`EbpfMapConfiguration <yaml-settings-EbpfMapConfiguration>` - IPv6 subnets map
- **qnames**: :ref:`EbpfMapConfiguration <yaml-settings-EbpfMapConfiguration>` - DNS names map
- **external**: Boolean ``(false)`` - If set to true, :program:`dnsdist` does not load the internal ``eBPF`` program. This is useful for ``AF_XDP`` and ``XDP`` maps


.. _yaml-settings-EbpfMapConfiguration:

EbpfMapConfiguration
--------------------

An ``eBPF`` map that is used to share data with kernel-land ``AF_XDP``/``XSK``, ``socket filter`` or ``XDP`` programs. Maps can be pinned to a filesystem path, which makes their content persistent across restarts and allows external programs to read their content and to add new entries. :program:`dnsdist` will try to load maps that are pinned to a filesystem path on startups, inheriting any existing entries, and fall back to creating them if they do not exist yet. Note that the user :program`dnsdist` is running under must have the right privileges to read and write to the given file, and to go through all the directories in the path leading to that file. The pinned path must be on a filesystem of type ``BPF``, usually below ``/sys/fs/bpf/``

- **max_entries**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Maximum number of entries in this map. 0 means no entry at all
- **pinned_path**: String ``("")`` - The filesystem path this map should be pinned to


.. _yaml-settings-EdnsClientSubnetConfiguration:

EdnsClientSubnetConfiguration
-----------------------------

EDNS Client Subnet-related settings

- **override_existing**: Boolean ``(false)`` - When ``useClientSubnet`` in :func:`newServer()` or ``use_client_subnet`` in :ref:`yaml-settings-BackendConfiguration` are set, and :program:`dnsdist` adds an EDNS Client Subnet Client option to the query, override an existing option already present in the query, if any. Please see Passing the source address to the backend for more information. Note that it’s not recommended to enable this option in front of an authoritative server responding with EDNS Client Subnet information as mismatching data (ECS scopes) can confuse clients and lead to SERVFAIL responses on downstream nameservers
- **source_prefix_v4**: Unsigned integer ``(32)`` - When ``useClientSubnet`` in :func:`newServer()` or ``use_client_subnet`` in :ref:`yaml-settings-BackendConfiguration` are set, and :program:`dnsdist` adds an EDNS Client Subnet Client option to the query, truncate the requestor's IPv4 address to this number of bits
- **source_prefix_v6**: Unsigned integer ``(56)`` - When ``useClientSubnet`` in :func:`newServer()` or ``use_client_subnet`` in :ref:`yaml-settings-BackendConfiguration` are set, and :program:`dnsdist` adds an EDNS Client Subnet Client option to the query, truncate the requestor's IPv6 address to this number of bits


.. _yaml-settings-GeneralConfiguration:

GeneralConfiguration
--------------------

General settings

- **edns_udp_payload_size_self_generated_answers**: Unsigned integer ``(1232)`` - Set the UDP payload size advertised via EDNS on self-generated responses. In accordance with :rfc:`RFC 6891 <6891#section-6.2.5>`, values lower than 512 will be treated as equal to 512
- **add_edns_to_self_generated_answers**: Boolean ``(true)`` - Whether to add EDNS to self-generated responses, provided that the initial query had EDNS
- **truncate_tc_answers**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Remove any left-over records in responses with the TC bit set, in accordance with :rfc:`RFC 6891 <6891#section-7>`
- **fixup_case**: Boolean ``(false)`` - If set, ensure that the case of the DNS qname in the response matches the one from the query
- **allow_empty_responses**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Set to true (defaults to false) to allow empty responses (qdcount=0) with a NoError or NXDomain rcode (default) from backends. dnsdist drops these responses by default because it can't match them against the initial query since they don't contain the qname, qtype and qclass, and therefore the risk of collision is much higher than with regular responses
- **drop_empty_queries**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Set to true (defaults to false) to drop empty queries (qdcount=0) right away, instead of answering with a NotImp rcode. dnsdist used to drop these queries by default because most rules and existing Lua code expects a query to have a qname, qtype and qclass. However :rfc:`7873` uses these queries to request a server cookie, and :rfc:`8906` as a conformance test, so answering these queries with NotImp is much better than not answering at all
- **capabilities_to_retain**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - Accept a Linux capability as a string, or a list of these, to retain after startup so that privileged operations can still be performed at runtime.
  Keeping ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` on kernel 5.8+ for example allows loading eBPF programs and altering eBPF maps at runtime even if the ``kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled`` sysctl is set.
  Note that this does not grant the capabilities to the process, doing so might be done by running it as root which we don't advise, or by adding capabilities via the systemd unit file, for example.
  Please also be aware that switching to a different user via ``--uid`` will still drop all capabilities."



.. _yaml-settings-HealthCheckConfiguration:

HealthCheckConfiguration
------------------------

Health-checks related settings for backends

- **mode**: String ``(auto)`` - The health-check mode to use: 'auto' which sends health-check queries every ``check_interval`` seconds, 'up' which considers that the backend is always available, 'down' that it is always not available, and 'lazy' which only sends health-check queries after a configurable amount of regular queries have failed (see :ref:`yaml-settings-LazyHealthCheckConfiguration` for more information). Default is 'auto'. See :ref:`Healthcheck` for a more detailed explanation. Supported values are: auto, down, lazy, up
- **qname**: String ``("")`` - The DNS name to use as QNAME in health-check queries
- **qclass**: String ``(IN)`` - The DNS class to use in health-check queries
- **qtype**: String ``(A)`` - The DNS type to use in health-check queries
- **function**: String ``("")`` - The name of an optional Lua function to call to dynamically set the QNAME, QTYPE and QCLASS to use in the health-check query (see :ref:`Healthcheck`)

Note that a proxy protocol payload will be required from these clients, regular DNS queries will no longer be accepted if they are not preceded by a proxy protocol payload. Be also aware that, if ``apply_acl_to_proxied_clients`` is set (default is false), the general ACL will be applied to the source IP address as seen by dnsdist first, but also to the source IP address provided in the Proxy Protocol header.
- **maximum_payload_size**: Unsigned integer ``(512)`` - Set the maximum size of a Proxy Protocol payload that dnsdist is willing to accept, in bytes. The default is 512, which is more than enough except for very large TLV data. This setting can’t be set to a value lower than 16 since it would deny of Proxy Protocol headers
